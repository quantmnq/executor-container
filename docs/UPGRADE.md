# Upgrade from 0.1.12, 0.2.0, 0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.3.2 or 0.4.0 to 0.4.1

English | [简体中文](UPGRADE.zh-CN.md)

Version 0.4.1 keeps 0.3.0's **balance sizing**: you choose a leverage fraction `f` above 0
and at most 1 of the leader's 6x balance sizing, and each new entry trades NQ plus
an MNQ remainder sized from your IBKR NetLiquidation and the `sizing.weight`
each signal carries for its trade (above 0, at most 1). See
[how sizing works](EXECUTOR.md#sizing) and the [release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md).

This guide is for the combined `follow-stack-…` container kit. Native
`follow-executor-…` installations need a reviewed migration; contact Auto Quant.

**You do not have to update immediately.** 0.2.0 keeps trading its fixed
quantity: the leader still sends `next_rth_open` exit plans (a stop cancel and
an exit shortly before the regular open), so 0.2.0's pre-open protection stays valid, and 0.2.0
ignores the new `sizing` field. It never uses signal weights or your balance.
With balance sizing, 0.4.1 reads your account value without holding up signals
and orders; an executor that has run for weeks without a restart also benefits
from the 0.4.0 speed-up.

## Starting from 0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.3.2 or 0.4.0

0.4.1 changes only when balance sizing reads your account value; the band, the
leverage fraction, the sizing formulas and the protection rules are unchanged.
Earlier releases read NetLiquidation every 30 seconds while flat, inside the
executor's trading loop, so a slow IBKR answer held up signals and orders in the
meantime. 0.4.1 reads it once per 5-minute bar, 2:00 to 3:00 into the bar, during
the Nasdaq cash session and only while flat with no working order, beside the
trading loop. An entry uses that reading when it is at most 360 seconds old and
no fill has been recorded since; otherwise it reads NetLiquidation directly, as
before. See [account-value checks](OPERATIONS.md#balance-sizing-account-values).
A fixed-size configuration reads no account value and is unchanged.

From 0.3.0, 0.3.1 or 0.3.2 it also adds the 0.4.0 changes. Earlier executors
re-recorded every fill since the process started on each step, so a long-running
executor slowed as fills accumulated (about 40 ms per step after 500 fills and
450 ms after 2,000), which also delayed order handling. 0.4.0 keeps a step under
1 ms at 2,000 fills, and quote updates no longer trigger extra steps. `./follow-stack gateway stop` now
refuses while the executor runs, as the container guide already required: stop
the executor while flat first. `./follow-stack status` shows a contract the
journal cannot name as `UNKNOWN` instead of leaving it out. From 0.3.0 or 0.3.1 it
also adds the 0.3.2 fix for account-value (NetLiquidation) reads, which current
Gateways stopped answering after two reads (IBKR error 322), and the latest read
under `sizing.account_value_health` in `./follow-stack status`; see
[account-value checks](OPERATIONS.md#balance-sizing-account-values). From 0.3.0
it also adds the 0.3.1 fixes: no IBKR client-ID collision (error 326) when
`./follow-stack settings` switches sizing, a setup retry for a mistyped
recovery-desktop password, an explanation of IBKR error 354 (missing market-data
subscription) and unrelated long stock holdings permitted during maintenance.
Journal, configuration and Gateway code are identical to 0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.3.2 and
0.4.0, so no migration is reviewed or needed. Use the steps below with your
`~/follow-stack-0.3.…-ubuntu24.04-arm64-cp312` or
`~/follow-stack-0.4.0-ubuntu24.04-arm64-cp312` directory in place of every 0.2.0
path, and skip step 6: your sizing, including balance sizing, is kept. Rolling
back to 0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.3.2 or 0.4.0 also keeps balance sizing.

## Starting from 0.1.12

The reviewed 0.1.12 Gateway change consists only of three setup messages about
separate Gateway and phone usernames. The updater accepts the exact published
old/new Gateway bytecode pair; journal and Docker Gateway code must still match.
Unknown changes remain blocked. Existing account mode, fixed size, credentials
and journal are preserved. Use the same steps below, substituting your retained
`~/follow-stack-0.1.12-ubuntu24.04-arm64-cp312` directory for every 0.2.0 path.
Do not stop until the account has no blocking positions or working orders (see the unrelated-stock exception below). Gateway must
be authenticated for the read-only maintenance check. An upgrade never starts
trading, changes account mode or selects balance sizing for you.

0.3.1 was the first kit with this compatibility fix; the v0.3.0 kit refuses
0.1.12, so upgrade directly to 0.4.1. Do not edit hashes to bypass checks.

## What is kept

The upgrade keeps your configuration, relay token, Gateway login files and data
volume, trading journal, notification history and any existing halt. It makes a
private backup of the configuration and a consistent journal backup. It replaces
the executor image and regenerates both service definitions. It never closes
positions, cancels orders or starts trading.

## 1. Check account positions and working orders

Choose a time with **no position and no working order** in the IBKR account, for
example after the scheduled exit or at the weekend. Check in IBKR, then from the
**0.2.0 directory**:

```bash
cd ~/follow-stack-0.2.0-ubuntu24.04-arm64-cp312
./follow-stack status
```

Require `"expected_positions": {}` and `"halt": null`. Never stop during a trade:
a stopped executor cannot move stops or run timed exits. If the executor is
halted, resolve that first with [operations](OPERATIONS.md); the upgrade keeps
halts.

## 2. Stop the executor while flat

Still in the 0.2.0 directory:

```bash
./follow-stack stop
```

Keep **Gateway logged in**; the upgrade's read-only maintenance check uses it.
Do not delete or move `~/.config/follow-executor` or
`~/.local/state/follow-executor`. Keep the 0.2.0 directory in place: the upgrade
and any rollback read it.

## 3. Copy, verify and extract the new kit

Transfer `follow-stack-0.4.1-ubuntu24.04-arm64-cp312.tar.gz` and its `.sha256`
to Ubuntu as in [setup step 3](SETUP.md#3-copy-and-verify-the-download), then:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
sha256sum -c follow-stack-0.4.1-ubuntu24.04-arm64-cp312.tar.gz.sha256
tar -xzf follow-stack-0.4.1-ubuntu24.04-arm64-cp312.tar.gz -C ~
cd ~/follow-stack-0.4.1-ubuntu24.04-arm64-cp312
```

Require `OK`. Extract into this **new** directory; never over 0.2.0.

## 4. Install the new kit and regenerate the services

From the 0.4.1 directory:

```bash
./follow-stack upgrade --from ~/follow-stack-0.2.0-ubuntu24.04-arm64-cp312
```

It verifies both kits, checks account-wide positions and orders without placing,
cancelling or simulating any order, and asks you to type the shown confirmation,
for example `UPGRADE PAPER 1 MNQ` (your current 0.2.0 size). It then backs up
privately, stops Gateway, installs the 0.4.1 executor image and rewrites the
executor and Gateway services. 0.2.0 to 0.4.1 is a reviewed migration: the
journal and Gateway code are unchanged and 0.2.0 settings load as they are.
**Both services stay stopped.**

If it reports an interrupted switch, follow
[maintenance recovery](CONTAINER_SETUP.md#upgrade-or-roll-back-while-flat).

## 5. Log Gateway back in

```bash
./follow-stack gateway start
```

Approve the IBKR Mobile prompt. Use the private VNC screen only if a login
dialog needs attention.

## 6. Choose your leverage fraction

Rerun the setup step that asks for the size:

```bash
./follow-stack settings
```

| Prompt | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Sizing `[MNQ]` (your current root) | Type `balance`. To keep your fixed 0.2.0 size instead, press Enter at this and the next prompt; nothing changes. |
| Leverage fraction of the leader's 6x band | Your chosen number above 0 and at most 1, for example `0.5`. `1` follows the leader's full size. |
| Approximate current NQ price, for the preview `(Enter to skip)` | Optional, for example `21000`. |

It checks NQ and MNQ are flat in IBKR, shows your IBKR NetLiquidation (or asks
for an approximate balance if IBKR does not report it) and the NQ/MNQ split at example weights, then saves `"sizing": {"mode": "balance",
"leverage_fraction": f}` and replaces `instrument`. Without a terminal you can
run `./follow-stack settings --leverage-fraction 0.5`. Your trade history is kept,
so finished trades are never re-entered.

A trade needing more NQ than `risk.max_quantity` (default 10) per order, a
trade whose size rounds to 0 contracts (for example weight 0.4 with a base of
1 MNQ unit), or a balance below one MNQ unit, would be refused without an
order; the preview and the check mark weights that round to 0 as `no entry`. Decide any limit change with Auto Quant; do not raise limits to make a
check pass.

## 7. Run the readiness checks

```bash
./follow-stack check
```

Require exit status 0 and `"problems": []`, quotes included, and compare
`leader_key_id` with the fingerprint from Auto Quant. Review the `sizing`
section: `leverage_fraction`, `net_liquidation`, each example weight's `book` such as
`1 NQ + 7 MNQ`, and `margin` with `"allowed": true`. Quotes may wait for the
market to open; rerun then.

## 8. Start

```bash
./follow-stack start
```

Type the confirmation only if it matches what you chose, for example
`START PAPER BALANCE 0.5`. Starting can submit paper orders immediately. Then:

```bash
./follow-stack service-status
./follow-stack status
```

Keep the 0.2.0 directory until you no longer need a rollback.

## Roll back to 0.2.0 or 0.1.12

For 0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.3.2 or 0.4.0, run `./follow-stack rollback` while stopped and flat; no size change
is needed. 0.2.0 and 0.1.12 cannot read balance sizing. While stopped and flat, from the 0.4.1
directory, first return to a fixed size, then roll back:

```bash
./follow-stack stop
./follow-stack settings --root MNQ --quantity 1
./follow-stack rollback
```

Rollback repeats the maintenance holdings/order check, keeps the current journal, and leaves
both services stopped. Continue from the 0.2.0 directory with `gateway start`,
`check` and an explicit `start`.

### Unrelated stock holdings during maintenance

The maintenance probe still requires complete account-wide position and open-order
snapshots. It permits unrelated long `STK` holdings, including fractional reward
shares. Futures of every root, short stocks, options, unknown contract types and
all working orders still block the switch. Missing stock symbols also block it.
This exception applies only to the upgrade/rollback maintenance probe; trading
readiness, journal reconciliation and start checks are unchanged. It does not
close or cancel anything, and a successful switch leaves both services stopped.
The report uses `maintenance_ready`, not `account_flat`, because permitted stock
holdings mean the account is not entirely flat.
