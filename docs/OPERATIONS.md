# Operations

English | [简体中文](OPERATIONS.zh-CN.md)

## Starts, stops and halts

`./follow start` checks readiness and enables the user service. `./follow stop`
disables it as well as stopping it, so it cannot unexpectedly resume on reboot.
Neither stopping nor disabling closes positions. Stop while flat for maintenance.
If you stop while holding a position, manage it through IBKR; locally timed
exits and stop adjustments no longer run.

`./follow status` reads the journal, not the current broker account. Use the IBKR
interface to verify actual positions and working orders. `./follow check` uses a
fresh broker snapshot, and must be run while the executor is stopped. `watch`
also needs the service stopped because a token supports one SSE connection.
A local process lock prevents overlapping run/check/watch/setup commands.

A halted executor continues repairing protection where possible. Inspect the
halt and the broker before `./follow resume`. Resume asks the running executor
to adopt current positions and align them with the target; that can submit an
exit. A new installation does not automatically adopt existing manual positions.

## Settings and risk limits

`./follow configure` or `./follow settings` without options reruns the sizing
wizard if config exists: `balance` with a leverage fraction (previewing the
NQ/MNQ split at example weights at IBKR NetLiquidation), or a fixed `MNQ`/`NQ` quantity.
`./follow settings --leverage-fraction 0.5` or
`./follow settings --root MNQ --quantity 2` does the same from the command line.
The service must be stopped and Gateway must be reachable and logged in.
Existing positions, working orders, incomplete broker snapshots or a halt refuse
the change. Switching roots, or to or from balance sizing, checks both MNQ and NQ. The journal is preserved,
including finished trades, so a setting change does not erase replay protection.

Default maximum quantity is 10 contracts (hard maximum 100). To change the cap,
stop while flat and edit `risk.max_quantity` in your private configuration, then
use `settings` for the desired quantity. `risk.max_margin_fraction` defaults to
0.5; `risk.max_stop_risk_usd` can impose an additional entry risk ceiling. These
settings are limits, not a recommendation for a suitable position size. NQ has
a different dollar multiplier from MNQ; the executor uses the selected root's
multiplier for its optional stop-risk calculation.

On first setup, `configure --advanced` allows a different relay, stream,
public key, Gateway host/port or client ID. Obtain the public key through a
trusted channel. Never store private keys or broker passwords in executor JSON.
The service uses the same fixed config path as `./follow`, independently of XDG
shell overrides; direct `follow-executor` commands also support `--config`.

The journal binds account, connection, stream, root and quantity. Direct edits
to those fields after setup are refused at run time: restore the old values,
then use the settings command. Normal size/root changes do not reset the journal.
If a disk failure interrupts a settings save and leaves a binding mismatch,
restore the previous configuration from your private backup before restarting;
do not erase the binding or journal to bypass it.

## Rotate the relay token

While stopped, replace the contents of
`~/.config/follow-executor/relay.token` in a local editor, keeping mode `0600`.
Run `./follow check`, then `./follow start`. The token must be a single nonempty
line. The token is separate from the config so it can be rotated without
changing account state. Never put it on a command line or in a Git commit.

## Paper to live, or another IBKR account

Do this only when flat, with no working orders. Verify both in IBKR, stop the
executor, run `./follow gateway stop`, and back up the config, token and journal
together in private storage (including local IBC credentials and Gateway settings).
To preserve isolation, move the entire `~/.config/follow-executor` directory and
`~/.local/state/follow-executor` directory to private backup paths. Do not delete
them. Recreate setup with `./follow configure`, select the new mode/account, and
rerun `./follow gateway configure` for that login and mode. Run
`./follow gateway start`, approve authentication, and complete `check` before `start`.
Moving configuration also moves the optional VNC password/startup files: if using
the desktop helper, stop it first and rerun `./scripts/gateway-desktop.sh` after
setup, or preserve those two desktop files in the config directory.

Never share one journal between accounts or run two instances with the same
account/client ID. Keep old account records; if a position remains, return to
its original setup and resolve it before switching. This is intentionally a
separate setup, not a live migration of open orders.

## Updates and backups

While flat with no working orders: `./follow stop`, `./follow gateway stop`, back
up private state, then
download and verify the next bytecode release. Extract it into its new version
directory and run its `./install.sh` to update both service paths. Run
`./follow gateway start`, approve any login prompt, then run `./follow check` and
`./follow start` there. Follow the [full setup guide](SETUP.md)
for download, verification, and rollback details. Installation does not overwrite
private config or the journal. Back up a stopped journal together with any SQLite
`-wal` and `-shm` files; preserve directory ownership and permissions. Do not copy
an old `.venv` into a new release or delete the journal during an upgrade.

The API source archive and SHA-256 are pinned in `scripts/install-ibapi.sh`.
IBC and native Gateway downloads are also checksum-pinned in their helpers.
A changed vendor download must be reviewed and released in a new package.
See [IBC operations](IBC.md) for credentials, scheduling and restart behavior. The customer bytecode release
requires CPython 3.12 on Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64; Python 3.13+ needs a new build.
